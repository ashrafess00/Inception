WRITING....

42 inception is an amazing projects which teached us not only the basics, but also the intermediate concepts of containerization, by building mariadb, nginix and also wordpress, connecting them with docker compose
here i will give you what i did in this project and simple commands which will help you

## What is Docker?
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.[click for more info](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)

before using docker compose i prefered to understand all those tecknologies invidually, running and set up them manually then building the Dockerfile fore each of them, that's why i will show commands required below and each tecknology and what does it mean,

## Mariadb

we have to build a mariadb docker image, so those are commands i used to create user etc
**install mariadb :**

    sudo apt-get install mariadb-server mariadb-client -y

`mysql_secure_installation` is essential to take steps to ensure that your database server is not vulnerable to unauthorized access or other security threats. this script basically provide a series of prompts and actions to enhance the security of your MySQL

but instead of using this script, i prefered to type in init.sql commands which are used by this command (automate it), [read more](https://bertvv.github.io/notes-to-self/2015/11/16/automating-mysql_secure_installation/)

those some command to setup the database, i created a user, and tables
**Create user**

    CREATE  USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY  'password';

 **Create database and tables**
    CREATE  DATABASE  IF  NOT  EXISTS mydbo;
    USE mydbo;
 

    CREATE  TABLE  IF  NOT  EXISTS users (
	    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	    age INT
    );
    
    INSERT INTO users (username, age) VALUES ('Me-Test', 23);

## Wordpress
**what is wordpress**
WordPress is one of the worldâ€™s most simple and popular content management systems or CMS for short. This means you provide the content while the platform does all the coding and organizing.
